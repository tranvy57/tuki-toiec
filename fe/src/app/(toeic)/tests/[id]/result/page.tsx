  aiAnalysis:
    "You have strong listening comprehension skills, particularly in Part 2 (Question-Response) where you achieved 88% accuracy. Your grammar foundation is solid as evidenced by your 90% accuracy in Part 5. However, there's room for improvement in reading fluency, especially in Part 7 where complex passages require better time management and context inference. Focus on expanding your business and academic vocabulary to tackle multi-passage questions more effectively.",
